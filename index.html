      <h1>Common signs of a struggling Veteran:</h1>
      <p>When veterans return from active duty, alcohol and other drugs may be used as a form of self-medication. Self-medication is often used to cope with feelings of stress, anxiety, depression, trauma, and other mental health conditions. The psychological effects of military service can feel unmanageable, and turning to substances may feel like the managing of symptoms.
      <br><br>
      Alcohol and other drugs provide veterans with temporary relief from symptoms they may be experiencing. However, increased levels of substance use can ultimately lead to consequences in the long term.</p>

      <h1>Why don't Veterans seek mental health?</h1>
      <p>They may be afraid of being labeled as weak or defective, and they may worry that others will judge them harshly or look down on them. This stigma can lead to feelings of shame and isolation, preventing veterans from getting the support they need to manage their symptoms and cope with their experiences.
      <br><br>
      44% to 72% of Veterans experience high levels of stress and anxiety during their transition from Military to Civilian life.

      <h1>Equipped to Thrive: My Hunt for Purpose Journey</h1>
      <p>After my first Fishing Experience (FX) with Warriors & Quiet Waters (WQW), I knew I had found something incredible. Looking at the person I was that day and the person I am today, the two don’t even compare. My time with WQW has been transformative, to say the least. I can honestly say that no single part of my life hasn’t been affected by WQW. I have been able to understand my purpose and find how to live a more fulfilling and thriving life.
